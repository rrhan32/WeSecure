Ensuring the Safety &amp; Security of women &amp; senior citizens using IT
We have envisioned an Internet-enabled, stand-alone
device that would be placed at the house's main
entrance and stay in standby mode until any motion is
detected. Upon detecting motion, the device would
activate its camera, take a sweep of the area, and
capture any faces in the vicinity using computer vision.
It would look for them in the database and then act on
it based on the logic structure defined by us.
